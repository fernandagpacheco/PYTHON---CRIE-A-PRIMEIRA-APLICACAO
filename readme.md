🎬 Tarantino's Reel Deal  
A terminal-based movie tracker with a Tarantino twist. Manage your personal collection of badass flicks with attitude and emojis.

💣 What It Does  
This Python app lets you:

🔫 Add new movies to your list  
🎞️ View your current movie lineup  
✅ Mark movies as “seen” or “not seen”  
💥 Exit with style  

All wrapped in a chaotic, Tarantino-flavored interface.


🛠️ Requirements

▸Python 3.x  
▸Works best on Windows (os.system("cls") is used to clear screen)  
▸On Linux/macOS, change cls to clear in the display_text() function.  
▸No external libraries required.  


🚀 How to Run  
▸Clone this repo or copy the code into a .py file. Then run:

2. List movies  
3. Upload movie  
4. Exit  


🧠Example Features
